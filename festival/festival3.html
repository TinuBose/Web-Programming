<p><i><h3 style="color:#6F124D; text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman"> Holi celebrates the arrival of spring, the end of winter, the blossoming of love and for many, it is a festive day to meet others, play and laugh, forget and forgive, and repair broken relationships.[18][23] The festival is also an invocation for a good spring harvest season.[18][23] It lasts for a night and a day, starting on the evening of the Purnima (Full Moon Day) falling in the Hindu calendar month of Phalguna, which falls around the middle of March in the Gregorian calendar. The first evening is known as "Holika Dahan" or "Chhoti Holi" and the following day as "Holi", "Rangwali Holi", "Dol Purnima", "Dhuleti", "Dhulandi",[24] "Ukuli", "Manjal Kuli",[25] "Yaosang", "Shigmo",[26] "Phagwah",[27] or "Jajiri". </h3></i></p>
